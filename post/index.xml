There are still many ways to improve the accuracy of ECG measurements and to design pacemakers in a better way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Title: Medical Hardware for Stimulation and Metrology of the Heart: Electrocardiogram and Pacemaker&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract: Electrocardiography (ECG) and pacemakers are two typical approaches for the evaluation and intervention of the mechanical and electrical activity of the heart. In this paper, we first analyzed the physiological processes of cardiac activity and then gave an exhaustive review of the multiple existing clinical and industrial applications. Finally, future directions for cardiac stimulation and metrology techniques are summarized by comparing advanced improvements with existing applications for more effective progress in this field.&lt;/p&gt;

This is one of the most advanced issues I have discussed until now, in fact many researchers are actively working on visually impaired treatment, but it is still a long way to go before it can be put into use due to the factor like bioadaptability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Title: Hardware Strategies in Medical Systems for Visually Impaired Treatment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract: Millions of blindness and visual impairment cases are caused by damage to the loss of photoreceptor function. Existing experiments and research have shown that electrical stimulation mechanisms can be established through different medical hardware strategies to help visually impaired patients partially recover their vision. Firstly, this paper analyzes the physiological principles to introduce the role of hardware systems in advanced visually impaired treatment schemes. Then, based on worldwide research advances in medical systems for visually impaired treatment, the latest hardware strategies and engineering issues of several representative systems are evaluated and compared in detail. Finally, the development prospect of medical hardware in the medical system is summarized on this basis for more efficient progress.&lt;/p&gt;

This work is an arduous and brave combination for me since medicine is not my specialized field, so I have to investigate more. The biomedical engineering field is still a great challenge for me, but I hope it would be good proof and inspire my research in other cross-cutting and multi-field research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Title: Performance and Security Enhancement Solutions for Positron Emission Tomography Medical Hardware&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is an emerging medical imaging methodology for diagnosing cancer. The optimization and security solutions surrounding this technology are essential issues in biomedical engineering. Low-resolution and unauthorized modification of medical images will affect clinical analysis and medical diagnostics. To improve image quality and security while minimizing its impact on medical hardware, this paper analyzes a highly integrated data acquisition approach based on Time-over-Threshold (ToT) and proposes a lightweight security solution based on Physically Unclonable Function (PUF) for PET scan medical hardware. Compared to existing applications, the time-based sampling method can provide very good image quality, and the proposed watermarking and encryption method based on PUF enables enhanced privacy protection with fewer hardware costs for PET medical imaging technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mentor is &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://sky.tiangong.edu.cn/2019/0319/c5270a39764/page.htm&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Huiquan Wang&lt;/a&gt; in my dissertation. He is the Associate Dean of the Faculty of Life Sciences in Tiangong University. This work was awarded the &amp;ldquo;Outstanding Final Destination Project of Tiangong University&amp;rdquo; because of its rich content (140 pages) and interesting practical work. My earliest papers date back to when I was a second-year at my Bachelorâ€™s university. I tried to do more as I assumed I would also do some research work in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
