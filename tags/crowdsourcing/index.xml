&lt;p&gt;This is my first publication and it was accepted during the second year of my undergraduate degree. It was the beginning of my research on IoT and hardware devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract: Internet of Things equipment using Narrow Band Internet of Thingsï¼ˆNB-IoTï¼‰ technology usually have many advantages such as low cost,low power consumption and wide coverage. A Big data combining with crowdsourcing model and based on NB-IoT technology of embedded real-time environmental monitoring equipment are analyzed,can be used to warn and forecast natural and man-made disasters to a certain extent at low cost and low power consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
