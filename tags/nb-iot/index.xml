&lt;p&gt;Abstract: The traditional greenhouse environmental monitoring equipment is not only poor in controllability,but also difficult to ensure the real-time feedback information and visual data. For example,in some parts of southern China,the planting areas of crops are mostly located in remote mountains,hills and valleys and other areas with poor network signal,making a large number of intelligent devices of the Internet of Things unable to play their due advantages and bring actual benefits to farmers. In this paper,an Intelligent agriculture system of the Internet of Things is designed based on Cat.1 module and the cloud platform of the Internet of Things. After testing,the system can not only realize the real-time visualization function of environmental parameter data,but also intelligently adjust and control the work of agricultural facilities such as floodlights and exhaust fans. It can not only save manpower and material resources,but also reduce power consumption. After large-scale deployment,the system can also improve the production quality of crops in the greenhouses,bringing inestimable economic and environmental value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my first publication and it was accepted during the second year of my undergraduate degree. It was the beginning of my research on IoT and hardware devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract: Internet of Things equipment using Narrow Band Internet of Thingsï¼ˆNB-IoTï¼‰ technology usually have many advantages such as low cost,low power consumption and wide coverage. A Big data combining with crowdsourcing model and based on NB-IoT technology of embedded real-time environmental monitoring equipment are analyzed,can be used to warn and forecast natural and man-made disasters to a certain extent at low cost and low power consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
