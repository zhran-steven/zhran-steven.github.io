There are still many ways to improve the accuracy of ECG measurements and to design pacemakers in a better way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Title: Medical Hardware for Stimulation and Metrology of the Heart: Electrocardiogram and Pacemaker&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract: Electrocardiography (ECG) and pacemakers are two typical approaches for the evaluation and intervention of the mechanical and electrical activity of the heart. In this paper, we first analyzed the physiological processes of cardiac activity and then gave an exhaustive review of the multiple existing clinical and industrial applications. Finally, future directions for cardiac stimulation and metrology techniques are summarized by comparing advanced improvements with existing applications for more effective progress in this field.&lt;/p&gt;
