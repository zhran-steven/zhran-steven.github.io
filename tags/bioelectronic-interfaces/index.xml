This is one of the most advanced issues I have discussed until now, in fact many researchers are actively working on visually impaired treatment, but it is still a long way to go before it can be put into use due to the factor like bioadaptability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Title: Hardware Strategies in Medical Systems for Visually Impaired Treatment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract: Millions of blindness and visual impairment cases are caused by damage to the loss of photoreceptor function. Existing experiments and research have shown that electrical stimulation mechanisms can be established through different medical hardware strategies to help visually impaired patients partially recover their vision. Firstly, this paper analyzes the physiological principles to introduce the role of hardware systems in advanced visually impaired treatment schemes. Then, based on worldwide research advances in medical systems for visually impaired treatment, the latest hardware strategies and engineering issues of several representative systems are evaluated and compared in detail. Finally, the development prospect of medical hardware in the medical system is summarized on this basis for more efficient progress.&lt;/p&gt;
