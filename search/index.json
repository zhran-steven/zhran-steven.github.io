There are still many ways to improve the accuracy of ECG measurements and to design pacemakers in a better way.\nAbstract: Electrocardiography (ECG) and pacemakers are two typical approaches for the evaluation and intervention of the mechanical and electrical activity of the heart. In this paper, we first analyzed the physiological processes of cardiac activity and then gave an exhaustive review of the multiple existing clinical and industrial applications. Finally, future directions for cardiac stimulation and metrology techniques are summarized by comparing advanced improvements with existing applications for more effective progress in this field.\nIEEE Xplore is Now Available\n","date":"2023-03-30T00:00:00Z","image":"https://www.ranzhuoheng.com/medical-hardware-for-stimulation-and-metrology-of-the-heart-electrocardiogram-and-pacemaker/IEEE_huec281a119e653c1a8b2a8d8aca022858_482451_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://www.ranzhuoheng.com/medical-hardware-for-stimulation-and-metrology-of-the-heart-electrocardiogram-and-pacemaker/","title":"Medical Hardware for Stimulation and Metrology of the Heart: Electrocardiogram and Pacemaker"},{"content":"My paper \u0026ldquo;Performance and Security Enhancement Solutions for Positron Emission Tomography Medical Hardwarehas\u0026rdquo; has already been presented at the 2022 IEEE International Conference on ICSAI ðŸŽ‰.\nI would like to thank those who have contributed to this work. This is one of the most advanced issues I have discussed until now, in fact many researchers are actively working on visually impaired treatment, but it is still a long way to go before it can be put into use due to the factor like bioadaptability.\nAbstract: Millions of blindness and visual impairment cases are caused by damage to the loss of photoreceptor function. Existing experiments and research have shown that electrical stimulation mechanisms can be established through different medical hardware strategies to help visually impaired patients partially recover their vision. Firstly, this paper analyzes the physiological principles to introduce the role of hardware systems in advanced visually impaired treatment schemes. Then, based on worldwide research advances in medical systems for visually impaired treatment, the latest hardware strategies and engineering issues of several representative systems are evaluated and compared in detail. Finally, the development prospect of medical hardware in the medical system is summarized on this basis for more efficient progress.\nIEEE Xplore is Now Available\n","date":"2023-01-09T00:00:00Z","image":"https://www.ranzhuoheng.com/hardware-strategies-in-medical-systems-for-visually-impaired-treatment/IEEE_huec281a119e653c1a8b2a8d8aca022858_482451_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://www.ranzhuoheng.com/hardware-strategies-in-medical-systems-for-visually-impaired-treatment/","title":"Hardware Strategies in Medical Systems for Visually Impaired Treatment"},{"content":"My paper \u0026ldquo;Performance and Security Enhancement Solutions for Positron Emission Tomography Medical Hardwarehas\u0026rdquo; has already been presented at the 2022 IEEE International Conference on ASID ðŸŽ‰.\nI would like to thank those who have contributed to this work. This work is an arduous and brave combination for me since medicine is not my specialized field, so I have to investigate more. The biomedical engineering field is still a great challenge for me, but I hope it can inspire my research in other cross-cutting and multi-disciplinary areas.\nAbstract: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is an emerging medical imaging methodology for diagnosing cancer. The optimization and security solutions surrounding this technology are essential issues in biomedical engineering. Low-resolution and unauthorized modification of medical images will affect clinical analysis and medical diagnostics. To improve image quality and security while minimizing its impact on medical hardware, this paper analyzes a highly integrated data acquisition approach based on Time-over-Threshold (ToT) and proposes a lightweight security solution based on Physically Unclonable Function (PUF) for PET scan medical hardware. Compared to existing applications, the time-based sampling method can provide very good image quality, and the proposed watermarking and encryption method based on PUF enables enhanced privacy protection with fewer hardware costs for PET medical imaging technology.\nIEEE Xplore is Now Available\n","date":"2023-01-03T00:00:00Z","image":"https://www.ranzhuoheng.com/performance-and-security-enhancement-solutions-for-positron-emission-tomography-medical-hardware/IEEE_huec281a119e653c1a8b2a8d8aca022858_482451_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://www.ranzhuoheng.com/performance-and-security-enhancement-solutions-for-positron-emission-tomography-medical-hardware/","title":"Performance and Security Enhancement Solutions for Positron Emission Tomography Medical Hardware"},{"content":"This is a work in progress.\nI am working with my supervisor, Dr. Basel Halak, who is an Associate Professor at the University of Southampton and the director of the C-IoT program, and I will provide real-time updates on our progress for those following this work.\nMore information and documents: Available\n","date":"2022-10-29T00:00:00Z","image":"https://www.ranzhuoheng.com/my-paper-is-under-review-by-ieee-access/IEEE_hu600260d85786b5dddaff488e6c90db66_18057_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://www.ranzhuoheng.com/my-paper-is-under-review-by-ieee-access/","title":"My paper is under review by IEEE ACCESS"},{"content":"This work is partly funded under College Students\u0026rsquo; Innovative Entrepreneurial Training Plan Program (202010058055) from Tiangong University.\nPatent Name: A two-way wireless charging system for UAV sets and its path planning design (translated by software)\nAbstract: The present invention discloses a two-way wireless charging system for an unmanned aircraft group and its path planning design, in which the structure of the said two-way wireless charging system for an unmanned aircraft group includes a wireless charging base station, two unmanned aircraft and a sensor.

This paper uses the STM32F103 microprocessor development platform to design a smart environment assistant based on the uC/OS-iii operating system and China Mobile\u0026rsquo;s OneNET IoT cloud platform. uC/OS series operating system not only has a lightweight kernel, but also has excellent stability. The OneNET IoT cloud platform provides real-time data collection, location awareness and other services. The system collects and displays environmental parameters such as smoke, PM2.5, temperature and humidity on an LCD screen, and also adds the ability to obtain hazard warning counts and travel advice indices. The GSM/GPRS communication module transmits monitoring data and warning and advice information to the OneNET IoT cloud platform via the MQTT transmission protocol. The user can access the information via PC or mobile app, which greatly improves the time and space limitations of traditional environmental monitoring equipment. The system also uses event flag groups to synchronise different tasks and optimises task priority settings, allowing people to focus on key parameters while achieving low power consumption and saving resources in the cloud. The system is not only suitable for monitoring and alarming hazardous gases in indoor environments, but can also be placed on balconies as an assistant for daily travel advice, which is practical and economical.

For example,in some parts of southern China,the planting areas of crops are mostly located in remote mountains,hills and valleys and other areas with poor network signal,making a large number of intelligent devices of the Internet of Things unable to play their due advantages and bring actual benefits to farmers. In this paper,an Intelligent agriculture system of the Internet of Things is designed based on Cat.1 module and the cloud platform of the Internet of Things. After testing,the system can not only realize the real-time visualization function of environmental parameter data,but also intelligently adjust and control the work of agricultural facilities such as floodlights and exhaust fans. It can not only save manpower and material resources,but also reduce power consumption. After large-scale deployment,the system can also improve the production quality of crops in the greenhouses,bringing inestimable economic and environmental value.\nChina National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) is Now Available\n","date":"2021-10-19T00:00:00Z","image":"https://www.ranzhuoheng.com/intelligent-agricultural-system-based-on-internet-of-things-and-cat.1-module/IEEE_hub8b9877b502abf49b154f81a7d19107d_113847_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://www.ranzhuoheng.com/intelligent-agricultural-system-based-on-internet-of-things-and-cat.1-module/","title":"Intelligent agricultural system based on Internet of Things and Cat.1 module"},{"content":"I have been working on designing a practical and dedicated system in my undergraduate degree using hardware, IoT and AI, and now it is being implemented and is available in the links on this page.
