There are still many ways to improve the accuracy of ECG measurements and to design pacemakers in a better way.\nTitle: Medical Hardware for Stimulation and Metrology of the Heart: Electrocardiogram and Pacemaker\nAbstract: Electrocardiography (ECG) and pacemakers are two typical approaches for the evaluation and intervention of the mechanical and electrical activity of the heart. In this paper, we first analyzed the physiological processes of cardiac activity and then gave an exhaustive review of the multiple existing clinical and industrial applications. Finally, future directions for cardiac stimulation and metrology techniques are summarized by comparing advanced improvements with existing applications for more effective progress in this field.\nMore information and documents: Available\n","date":"2023-03-30T00:00:00Z","image":"https://www.ranzhuoheng.com/my-paper-has-been-presented-at-the-2023-ieee-iccrd-conference/IEEE_huec281a119e653c1a8b2a8d8aca022858_482451_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://www.ranzhuoheng.com/my-paper-has-been-presented-at-the-2023-ieee-iccrd-conference/","title":"My paper has been presented at the 2023 IEEE ICCRD Conference ðŸŽ‰"},{"content":"I would like to thank those who have contributed to this work. This is one of the most advanced issues I have discussed until now, in fact many researchers are actively working on visually impaired treatment, but it is still a long way to go before it can be put into use due to the factor like bioadaptability.\nTitle: Hardware Strategies in Medical Systems for Visually Impaired Treatment\nAbstract: Millions of blindness and visual impairment cases are caused by damage to the loss of photoreceptor function. Existing experiments and research have shown that electrical stimulation mechanisms can be established through different medical hardware strategies to help visually impaired patients partially recover their vision. Firstly, this paper analyzes the physiological principles to introduce the role of hardware systems in advanced visually impaired treatment schemes. Then, based on worldwide research advances in medical systems for visually impaired treatment, the latest hardware strategies and engineering issues of several representative systems are evaluated and compared in detail. Finally, the development prospect of medical hardware in the medical system is summarized on this basis for more efficient progress.\nMore information and documents: Available\n","date":"2023-01-09T00:00:00Z","image":"https://www.ranzhuoheng.com/my-paper-has-been-presented-at-the-2022-ieee-icsai-conference/IEEE_huec281a119e653c1a8b2a8d8aca022858_482451_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://www.ranzhuoheng.com/my-paper-has-been-presented-at-the-2022-ieee-icsai-conference/","title":"My paper has been presented at the 2022 IEEE ICSAI Conference ðŸŽ‰"},{"content":"I would like to thank those who have contributed to this work. This work is an arduous and brave combination for me since medicine is not my specialized field, so I have to investigate more. The biomedical engineering field is still a great challenge for me, but I hope it would be good proof and inspire my research in other cross-cutting and multi-field research.\nTitle: Performance and Security Enhancement Solutions for Positron Emission Tomography Medical Hardware\nAbstract: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is an emerging medical imaging methodology for diagnosing cancer. The optimization and security solutions surrounding this technology are essential issues in biomedical engineering. Low-resolution and unauthorized modification of medical images will affect clinical analysis and medical diagnostics. To improve image quality and security while minimizing its impact on medical hardware, this paper analyzes a highly integrated data acquisition approach based on Time-over-Threshold (ToT) and proposes a lightweight security solution based on Physically Unclonable Function (PUF) for PET scan medical hardware. Compared to existing applications, the time-based sampling method can provide very good image quality, and the proposed watermarking and encryption method based on PUF enables enhanced privacy protection with fewer hardware costs for PET medical imaging technology.\nMore information and documents: Available\n","date":"2023-01-03T00:00:00Z","image":"https://www.ranzhuoheng.com/my-paper-has-been-presented-at-the-2022-ieee-asid-conference/IEEE_huec281a119e653c1a8b2a8d8aca022858_482451_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://www.ranzhuoheng.com/my-paper-has-been-presented-at-the-2022-ieee-asid-conference/","title":"My paper has been presented at the 2022 IEEE ASID Conference ðŸŽ‰"},{"content":"This is a work in progress.\nI am working with my supervisor, Dr. Basel Halak, on the publication of my dissertation, and I will provide real-time updates on our progress for those following this work.\nMore information and documents: Available\n","date":"2022-10-29T00:00:00Z","image":"https://www.ranzhuoheng.com/my-paper-is-under-review-by-ieee-access/IEEE_hu600260d85786b5dddaff488e6c90db66_18057_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://www.ranzhuoheng.com/my-paper-is-under-review-by-ieee-access/","title":"My paper is under review by IEEE ACCESS"},{"content":"Some of my outcomes and dissertation are here at the Bachelor.\nMy mentor is Huiquan Wang in my dissertation.
