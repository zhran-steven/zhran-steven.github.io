        <description>&lt;p&gt;It is generally challenging for most researchers to push human society one small step forward, even though we are usually assumed to be doing that in the eyes of non-researchers. Some of my previous work also looks like this, such as improving the work of other researchers in my field by a small step. This is quite normal because we can&amp;rsquo;t always contribute considerably during our short academic careers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no so-called most excellent research in the world, which is a false proposition for anyone, whether for a beginner or a Nobel Prize winner in their field. But I always imagine that if I have one perfect research, I think it will be excellent and potentially provide enormous value to human society during my PhD academic career. It may seem not easy, but it is our primary responsibility in the eyes of non-researchers. At the same time, I think doing anything with a pure attitude is popular but challenging in any industry and field. Through this project, I expect to do at least one impressive piece of research that might be remarkable, which is the original motivation for setting up this project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Hartley Library, University of Southampton, UK.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>About Me</title>

        <guid>https://www.ranzhuoheng.com/about-me/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently finished my postgraduate research at the University of Southampton&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;School of Electronics and Computer Science(ECS)&lt;/a&gt;, which is &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/education/ng-interactive/2021/sep/11/the-best-uk-universities-2022-rankings&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;1st in the UK for Electrical and Electronic Engineering&lt;/a&gt;. My supervisor is &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=2PifIaUAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Dr. Basel Halak&lt;/a&gt;. He is Associate Professor and the director of the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.c-iot.ecs.soton.ac.uk/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;C-IoT program&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the world will need more IoT-based smart devices in the future, and they may be constrained by power consumption and size. And security will be the biggest issue for such devices in the background of the technology that has been fully developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My research interests include including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AIoT security&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Digital System Design with FPGA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wearable Medical Devices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the basic research programme, I also proposed the Excellence Research Programme when I was still studying for my Master in Southampton and planning to do my PhD, which aimed to complete an absolutely leading excellence research over four years and publish it in a high-level journal, it might consist of several supportive top conferences. Scholars from around the world are welcome to contribute to this programme.&lt;/p&gt;
