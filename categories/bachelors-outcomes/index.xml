        <description>&lt;img src="https://www.ranzhuoheng.com/outcomes-and-dissertation-bachelor/University.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Outcomes and Dissertation (Bachelor)" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have been working on designing a practical and dedicated system in my undergraduate degree using hardware, IoT and AI, and now it is being implemented and is available in the links on this page. Although it still has limitations, I have used almost most of the tools and experience I learnt at university. I have also found many ideas in practice that were once too ideal, so it was a good try for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this work, I would like to express my gratitude to my undergraduate dissertation supervisor &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://sky.tiangong.edu.cn/2019/0319/c5270a39764/page.htm&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Prof. Huiquan Wang&lt;/a&gt;, who is the Associate Dean of the Faculty of Life Sciences in Tiangong University and guided me on how to make a good design. Eventually, this work was awarded the &amp;ldquo;Outstanding Final Project of Tiangong University&amp;rdquo; because of its rich content (140 pages with 0.8% similarity rate) and technical combinations. My earliest journal was accepted when I was in my second year of undergraduate university. I am doing more and gaining experience to target for potential future research positions.&lt;/p&gt;
